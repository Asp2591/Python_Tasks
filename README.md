## Python Developer Intern Tasks
## Hii ATharva Here!!
# Tasks:
1. Find the missing number in a sequence
2. Find the first non-repeating character in a string
3. Find the longest consecutive sequence in an array
4. Find the k-th largest element in an array

### My Approach:
1. Used Math formula of sum of n natural numbers and loop for trace.
2. Dictonary to store character and respected count, it returns unique/non-repeating char from dict.
3. Find current index and next index number whether it is consecutive or not and return longest streak.
4. Used sorting method and reverse indexing to find kth largest number.

### How to Run:
1. Python 3.12 used.
2. Run with: 'python task1.py', etc.
